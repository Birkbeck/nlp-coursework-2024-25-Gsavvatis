The Fletch-Kinkage score isn't always a good way to measure how hard 
a text is, because sometimes it assumes that the text would have a 
normal sentence structure, and if the text has loads of short 
sentences, let's say like in a dialogue, then the score might 
say that it's easy, even though there's a deep meaning in the 
dialogue.Another reason the Flesch-Kincaid score isn’t always 
reliable is because it depends on counting syllables in each word. 
But this isn’t always accurate. If a word isn’t in the special 
dictionary used, like the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, the function 
might guess the syllables wrong. That can mess up the final score 
and make the text seem easier or harder than it really is.
